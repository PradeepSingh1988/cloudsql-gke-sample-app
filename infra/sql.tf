  # Because Cloud IAM acts as a primary authentication and authorization mechanism,
  # we can consider MySQL usernames and passwords are a secondary access controls
  # that can be used to further restrict access for reliability or safety purposes. 
  # For example, removing the ability of modifying tables from production users 
  # that don't need such a capability. The module, by default, creates users that:
  # 1. only allow connections from host ~cloudsqlproxy to ensure that nobody can access 
  #    data without connecting via the Cloud SQL Proxy.
  # 2. have randomly generated passwords, which can be stored in configuration files. 
  #    Such passwords can be considered as secure as API Keys rather than strong credentials for access.
  # more details here: https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-sql-db/tree/master/modules/safer_mysql#define-mysql-users-and-passwords-on-your-instance
